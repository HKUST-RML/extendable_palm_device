The extendable palm device is a robotic end-effector that can be retrofitted onto existing robotic grippers. It is consturcted as a parallel mechanism that can produce a striaght line motion for the palm while avoiding collisions with the base gripper as can be seen in the videos above. Our 3D-printed prototype is acutated by one Dynamixel AX-12A servo motor connected with a simple gear train. For reproduction of the extendable palm device, please refer to the bill of materials and the link for the Solidworks model made available below.
